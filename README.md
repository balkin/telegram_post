Drupal module to announce posts to Telegram

This module is based on http://lib365.ru/drupal-7/3, but has many improvements and way more to go!

I'm trying to improve the module, make it more usable, and (ideally) to publish it on drupal.org

# TODO
* Make sure everything is localized properly (Russian and English)
* Link shortening support
* Get rid of CURL or support standard PHP library
* Support Drupal 8
* Publish to drupal.org
* "Extract supermodule": announce on search engines, twitter, telegram, social networks, crosspost to livejournal, whatever
